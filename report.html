		<h1>Report for Project 3</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Link to the deployed version of our app:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://hansensandrew.github.io/Project-3/">Our Project</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				What our app does:
				<ul>
					<li>
						There are many movies adapted from books. Using free APIs, we
						created a website that can find if there is a movie based on a book
						by its title.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Requirements:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Does your site (or "app") for this project deploy publicly? Yes, our
						site is deployed on github via github pages.
					</li>
					<li>
						Does your site have varying presentaion on mobile and on larger
						viewports?
						<p class="response">
							Yes, our site has two presentations, one is for desktop browsers
							(larger than 950px in width) and the other is for mobile or tablet
							browsers (less than 950px in width).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Does your site use at least 2 existing APIs to create functionality?
						<p class="response">
							Yes, our site uses two API's, one is the openlibrary api which
							stores a collection of books and book related items (book box
							sets, themed bookmarks, etc) and the other is the omdb api which
							stores a collection of movies and movie related items (tv shows,
							video games, etc).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Does your app have some kind of search?
						<p class="response">
							Yes, our site prompts the user to search for books via title,
							author, or dates. However, the API does not support by both title
							and dates, or author and dates, so if you fill all three fields,
							the search will run twice, once for the author and title, and a
							second time for the date range.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Does your app display the results of the search?
						<p class="response">
							Yes, our site appends the results of the search to a div element
							that expands dynamically to fit the number of results.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Can the vistor filter, sort, or manipulate the results given?
						<p class="response">
							Yes, the site allows users to filter results in 4 different ways.
							The results can be filtered alphabetically by title, reverse
							alphabetically by title, from oldest publication date to newest,
							and from newest publication date to oldest.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
